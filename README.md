1.Introduction
I always believe in quote “GOOD BOOKS ARE OUR BEST FRIENDS”.
Undoubtable, books are always a good way to learn and entertain.
This website main purpose is allowing the user to purchase digital books (ebook) or the physical book (printed books). This app provides a sample pages to
view before purchase and allow to store user preferred collections.
This site will help the people in this modern era to still connect with books
and helps people to entertain and learn in the free times.
